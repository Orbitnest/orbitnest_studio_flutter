// Regression test for the "logged out on every restart after 15 min" bug.
//
// The /auth/refresh route is unguarded server-side and authenticates off the
// refresh_token in the request body — it needs no Bearer access token. The
// AuthInterceptor must therefore treat it as a token-less auth endpoint and
// short-circuit in onRequest WITHOUT calling TokenManager.getAccessToken().
//
// If it doesn't, the cold-start refresh POST triggers a proactive refresh from
// inside onRequest (the access token is already expired), which re-enters the
// in-flight refresh future the POST itself belongs to and self-deadlocks — the
// refresh never completes and the session is cleared.
//
// We pin the behaviour by routing a '/auth/refresh' request through onRequest
// and asserting it passes straight through with no Authorization header and
// without touching the TokenManager (whose secure-storage reads would throw
// MissingPluginException in a plain unit test — a useful tripwire: if the path
// were ever removed from the skip-list, this test would fail loudly).
